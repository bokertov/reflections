Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A ".git" directory will be created which contains version information.
We need to do this, so that it no longer only contains current files but
different versions of the files as well.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Staging area can contain files from different working directories.
It prepares for a commit.
