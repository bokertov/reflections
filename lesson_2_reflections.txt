different versions of the files as well.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Staging area can contain files from different working directories.
It prepares for a commit.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: Can edit multiple files at the same time, but only do "git add" etc. for files that belong to the same logical change.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
